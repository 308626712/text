This repository holds supplementary Go libraries for text processing, many involving Unicode.

To submit changes to this repository, see http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html.

To generate the tables in this repository (except for the encoding tables),
run go generate from this directory. By default tables are generated for the
Unicode version in core and the CLDR version defined in
golang.org/x/text/unicode/cldr.

Running go generate will as a side effect create a DATA subdirectory in this
directory which holds all files that are used as a source for generating the
tables. This directory will also serve as a cache.

TODO:
- conformance testing (test with -tags icu).
- updating unversioned source files.
